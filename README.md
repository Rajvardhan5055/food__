Food 
Food waste reduction is a critical initiative aimed at minimizing the unnecessary disposal of edible food throughout the production, distribution, and consumption chain. It involves implementing strategies and practices to prevent, reduce, or divert food from being wasted, thereby conserving valuable resources, reducing environmental impacts, and addressing food insecurity.

Key components of food waste reduction include:

Awareness and Education: Educating individuals, households, businesses, and communities about the impacts of food waste and the importance of reducing it through various means such as campaigns, workshops, and educational materials.

Food Recovery and Redistribution: Establishing systems to recover surplus food from producers, retailers, and restaurants and redistributing it to those in need through food banks, shelters, or other charitable organizations.

Food Preservation Techniques: Promoting methods such as canning, freezing, drying, and pickling to extend the shelf life of perishable foods and prevent them from spoiling prematurely.

Portion Control and Meal Planning: Encouraging consumers to plan their meals, purchase only what they need, and practice portion control to avoid overbuying and subsequently wasting food.

Composting and Organic Waste Management: Encouraging composting of food scraps and organic waste to divert them from landfills and instead use them to enrich soil health and support agricultural sustainability.
